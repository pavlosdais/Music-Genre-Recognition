# Music Genre Recognition

This project focuses on classifying one-second audio clips into four genres: **classical, pop, rock,** and **blues** using machine learning techniques. By processing MFCCs and mel-spectrograms, we combine traditional audio processing techniques with modern deep learning methods to achieve accurate predictions.

## **Features**
- Audio Representations:
  - MFCCs: Extracted features (mean and standard deviation) for each clip.
  - Mel-Spectrograms: Time-frequency representations of audio.
- Deep Learning Models:
  - Feedforward Neural Networks (FNNs) for MFCC-based classification.
  - Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for mel-spectrogram-based classification.

## **Results**
Overall, the combination of traditional audio processing techniques with advanced neural network architectures achieves reliable and scalable results in the domain of music genre classification.
